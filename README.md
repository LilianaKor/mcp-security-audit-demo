# mcp-security-audit-demo
This project demonstrates a practical security audit of Model Context Protocol (MCP) usage in a local development environment.  The goal is to identify whether any MCP servers are present, understand where they are configured, and assess potential security risks — especially in environments using AI-assisted development tools.
